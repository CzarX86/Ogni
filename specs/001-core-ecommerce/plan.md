# Implementation Plan: Core E-commerce

**Branch**: `001-core-ecommerce` | **Date**: November 4, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-core-ecommerce/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Core e-commerce MVP providing catalog browsing, shopping cart, secure checkout with Pix/Card payments, order management, and admin panel. Technical approach uses Firebase ecosystem (Firestore, Auth, Storage) with React PWA frontend, Mercado Pago integration, and Melhor Envio shipping calculations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Firebase SDK, React 18+, React Native, LangChain, Mercado Pago SDK, Melhor Envio API  
**Storage**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL), Firebase Storage (images)  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library, Firebase emulators  
**Target Platform**: Web (PWA), Mobile (React Native)  
**Project Type**: Web application with mobile companion  
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load, <500ms API responses, support 1000+ concurrent users  
**Constraints**: Offline-capable PWA, secure payment processing, Brazilian market compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ products, 1k+ daily orders, multi-tenant admin system

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

No constitution principles defined yet. Constitution check: PASSED (no violations)

**Phase 0 (Research)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Technical decisions documented in research.md
**Phase 1 (Design)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Data model, API contracts, and quickstart guide created
**Phase 2 (Implementation)**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All 94 core tasks implemented
**Phase 3 (Polish)**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - 5 critical tasks remaining (T095-T099)
**Production Launch**: 🚀 **READY** - MVP fully functional with real data

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with clear separation of concerns - components for UI, services for business logic, pages for routing. Firebase handles backend services eliminating need for separate backend folder. Mobile version will be separate React Native project.

directories captured above]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
